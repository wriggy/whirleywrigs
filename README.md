### Mastermind
Some python code with visualisations in jupyter notebook. The idea was for the computer to play mastermind using random selection from viable options. On average it took just over 5 goes (for 8 possible colours, duplicates allowed).

### Multiline
A first attempt with D3 - plotting multiple time series with gaps.
