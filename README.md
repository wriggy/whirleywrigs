Miscellaneous 

### Mastermind
Some python code with visualisations in a jupyter notebook. The idea is for the computer to play mastermind using random selection from viable options. On average it took just over 5 goes (for 8 possible colours, duplicates allowed). A bit quicker than I expected.

### Sudoku solver
I can't be the only person who just as they're filling in the last square realise they messed up somewhere along the line and have a duplicate. Frustration. Here's some code to solve those sudokus. Another jupyter notebook.

### Multiline
A first attempt with D3 - plotting multiple time series with gaps.
